# 👁️ Eye Blink Counter using Python + OpenCV + dlib + SciPy

This project implements an Eye Blink Detection system using Python 🐍 along with OpenCV, dlib, and SciPy. It counts human blinks in real-time using facial landmark detection and the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal is to detect and count **eye blinks** in real-time video using computer vision techniques. This can be extended for:

- Health and drowsiness detection
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Robotics and automation systems

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** – Programming Language
- **OpenCV** – Real-time Computer Vision
- **dlib** – Face Landmark Detection
- **SciPy** – EAR calculation and signal processing

---

## 📁 Features

- ✅ Real-time face and eye tracking
- ✅ Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) based blink detection
- ✅ Frame-based blink counting
- ✅ Easily integrable into robotics or embedded systems

## 🧠 How It Works

- Detects facial landmarks using **dlib**
- Calculates **EAR** for both eyes
- Registers a blink when EAR falls below a threshold
- Counts the number of blinks over time
